# Ingredients (2 loaves of bread)



1. Leaven
    * Sourdough in the refrigerator that was fed at least a week ago
    * 100 g of water
    * 100 g of whole wheat flour
2. Dough
    * 800 g of white wheat flour
    * 200 g of whole wheat flour
    * 680 g of water
        * Can be divided into 120 g and 560 g ahead of time
    * 20 g of salt


## Roles of ingredients

Whole wheat flour provides flavor. White flour is a source of gluten to make it easier to work with the dough. The proportions can be adjusted to taste, but 20%+80% is a classic recipe.

The amount of water affects the size of the holes in the bread. 65-80% percent is used for wheat. If there is not enough water, the bread may be dry and not rise. If there is too much, it will be difficult to work with the dough and it may not rise due to the fact that it is almost liquid and has no structure. You need to find your optimal proportion. Whole wheat flour can hold more water.

# Recipe

Bread is made in three days, but the amount of busy work is low. Next is a schedule in which only the ratios of the time interval are important, not the specific start time. That is, on any day, the entire schedule can be moved for a couple of hours forward or backward for convenience. With more experience even relative times can be adjusted.


## Day 1 - revitalization of the sourdough starter


### 18:00

Take the sourdough out of the fridge and mix as usual. Leave at room temperature


### 22:00

I put the starter in the refrigerator.


## Day 2 - preparation of the dough


### 8:00

Mix "levain" - this is a special portion of the starter that will be used for baking.

First, mix 25 g of sourdough from the refrigerator and 100 g of water. Mix it up for the leaven to dissolve. Then add 100 g of whole grain flour. This sequence helps to stir the leaven the best.

Put this in a jar or soup bowl and cover with cling film. You can poke a small hole in the film with a knife so that air can escape. The vessel should be large enough for the leaven to double in size.

Leave the container on the table.


### 12:00

Pour 640 g of water into a large vessel. Throw in all the levain. If it floats there and does not sink, it is a good sign. If not - nothing. Stir it up. After that, add flour and mix directly in the vessel, the mass will not become uniform. DO NOT add salt!

Leave it on the table.

This phase is called "autolysis" - mixing the dough and leaving to rest WITHOUT salt. Some people do not add leaven either, they add it in the next step. Autolysis does not seem to make any sense, but in fact it significantly improves the structure of the dough due to certain chemical processes.


### 12:30

Mix the remaining 160 g of water into the dough in small portions, about 20 g. Mix in portions or the whole salt amount at the same time. Start the next portion only when the previous one is completely mixed.

Cover the bowl loosely. Some people cover it with a wet towel.

This phase is called "bassinage" - adding the remaining water after autolysis, and not immediately. In theory, it improves the elasticity of the dough. Some people skip it and mix in all the water at once, except for 20 g, which helps dissolve the salt.


### 13:00

Wet your hands with water.

Without removing the dough from the bowl, put your hands under the dough, pull its side up and place this stretched side on top of the dough. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. And so a total of 4 times from all 4 sides.

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYzxulQY1Gc)

This phase is called “stretch & fold” and forms the gluten network as well as the surface tension of the dough.


### 14:00

Repeat the previous point.


### 15:00

Repeat the previous point.

It is during this phase that various additives are added to the dough - cheese, dried fruits, herbs. Once added, the dough is more difficult to work with, so it's best to learn how to do without it first.

After this final stretch the dough should resemble stretchiness of buffalo mozzarella on pizza. If it is not, you can make a note to experiment with the total number of water _next time,_ maybe your flour is slightly different. Do not attempt to fix it by adding water this time.


### 15:30

Pour flour on a clean table. The best flour for dusting tables, bannetons or hands is rice flour, regardless of the flour for the bread. It remains separate and does not disappear in the dough by itself.

Put the dough on top of the flour. Cut the dough into 2 parts with a baker's knife. The dough can stick, but it easily falls behind if you move it around the table with a baker's knife.

Stretch each part a little, form a circle. Then, using a technique similar to "stretch & fold", form a ball-like shape. Every stretch creates more tension in relaxed dough. The difference is that now it happens on the table and you can pull not only 4 times from all sides, but more. It is advisable not to pull the flour too much on top, so that the dough does not stop sticking.

Leave both balls on the table with the sticky side up, do not turn them over.

Prepare bannetons (bowls with cloth) and sprinkle them with flour as well.


### 16:00

The balls have flattened on the table a little. Return them to their shape in the same way as before, lightly folding them from the sides to the center.

Turn the balls over and use a baker's knife to give them an even better shape.[Video from 2:20](https://youtu.be/Koab3fxN4t4?t=140).

Then, insert a baker's knife under the ball and holding it with your hand, transfer the ball to the banneton, turning the ball over again. The “seam side” (the opposite to “smooth side”) that together should be up again, and the smooth stretched surface of the ball should be down.

The purpose of this step is to create surface tension on the dough.

Cover both bannetons with a towel.


### 18:00

Now, if you press on the dough with your finger, it returns to its original shape in a couple of seconds, but not fully risen and wait more. Ideally a small dent should remain. It feels like the dough is soft and puffy (it is not explainable in words).

Move both bannetons covered with towels to the refrigerator.

In the refrigerator, the growth of the dough will stop, the yeast will fall asleep. But the bacteria will continue to work, making the dough more sour, forming a complex taste and aftertaste, improving the digestiveness of bread.


## Day 3 - baking


### 16:00

This time is considered ideal for baking. But the bread is ready for baking already from 8 o'clock in the morning. The less it is infused, the less complex its taste will be. But if you insist too long, after 16:00 or even until the 4th day, there is a risk of losing the growth of the bread in the oven. This is done for people who have problems with wheat digestion and need bread that has processed bacteria as much as possible.

Pour a vessel of water and put it in the oven. The temperature is 230 degrees. Let the oven warm up for 10-15 minutes until it reaches this temperature.

Take one banneton out of the fridge. Sprinkle the surface with flour.

Prepare a pan or baking surface.

Cut out a square from baking paper. Place it on top of the banneton with the dough and place your hand on top with your fingers apart. Put the other hand under the banneton and check the banneton. Place it carefully on the table. And remove the banneton with the fabric that is now on top. There is now dough on the paper on the table.

Move it to the baking surface and cut off the excess paper. Sprinkle with flour.

Pass the blade in several places along the dough, possibly along the entire length. You can cross. It should go at least a centimeter and open a slot in the dough. This is the most difficult and will get better over time.[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54iZrTb2EqU).

If the dough stretches and tears, then either the blade is not positioned correctly, or the dough stood too long the previous day between 16:00 and 17:30, this time can be shortened.

Put the baking surface in the oven, where the water should already be boiling gently on the other grid. Bake for 50 minutes at a temperature of 230 degrees.

Then take out the water and bake for 5 minutes to form a crust.

Remove from the oven and place the bread on a wire rack to let it breathe and cool for more than 1 hour. If you cut it right away, it will give the impression that it is raw. But he has to "get ready" in an hour.

Do not forget to bake a second loaf of bread.


## Adjusting the recipe for next time

Now you can analyze what to improve next time.



* The bread is moldy even after 1 hour.
    * Unfortunately, you can't bake it, but you can make toast. Next time, bake for more than 45 minutes with water.
* The bread burned from the bottom.
    * There is not enough flour on the bottom.
* The crust is too hard
    * Make the final baking stage without water shorter.
* The bread did not rise well
    * Most likely - bad starter, we need to feed it for another week
        * Alternative way to revitalize the starter is to do it late at night before going to sleep and then NOT put it into the fridge. The absolutely strongest way to revitalize it is to do it twice: from 18:00 to 23:00 and then from 23:00 to the morning without putting it in the fridge. Whatever works.
    * It is cold or hot in the house. Try to increase or decrease the period on Day 2, 16:00 - 17:30.
    * Try more or less water plus or minus 5%.
* The slits look like the rest of the surface of the bread. And the bread is not rising high
    * Improve the technique of scoring the bread. Watch some video on YT


# Sourdough starter tips

Get whole grain flour. Then you mix 50-70 g of flour with the same amount (mass) of water in a glass cup (large enough to keep the double of it). 1:1 proportion. You cover it with food film with a little hole in it on the top. Next day at the same time you take a clean cup and put a part of yesterday's starter, new flour and filtered water: 1:1:1 proportion, e.g. 60 g : 60 g : 60 g. The rest of the starter can be thrown away or to the pancake mix.

Then you do it for a week (every day 1:1:1) or so until you have three days of reliable rising to twice the volume at peak. Then it's done and it can live forever (literally centuries).

After that you move it to the fridge and do the same procedure, but now once a week. You can leave it for a month too if you go on vacation. It is a super stable ecosystem of yeast and bacteria that kills everything else: all uncompatible yeast, bacteria and fungus. You need to starve it for longer than a month to kill it.

There are variants of doing it differently, by adding an apple or hops, but those can be tried after the simple recipe failed. Maybe you have weird microscopic cultures around your kitchen, so a boost is needed. Usually it just works.
